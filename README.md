Constructed symptom-disease hypergraphs from real-world clinical datasets to model complex many-to-many relations between symptoms and diseases. Applied and compared two unsupervised clustering techniques—Iteratively Reweighted Modularity Maximization (IRMM) and Mutual Information Maximization—on the resulting hypergraphs. Assessed clustering quality using semantic similarity measures and alignment with ICD codes. Found that Mutual Information Maximization yielded higher clinical coherence, while IRMM demonstrated superior scalability, offering trade-offs valuable for large-scale diagnostic applications.
